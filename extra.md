### Additional Project Ideas for Learning Scaling and CS Fundamentals

This document outlines additional projects to help deepen your understanding of **computer science** concepts and **scaling systems**.

## **Low-Level and Systems Projects**

1. **Key-Value Store (In-Memory Database)**

   - Build a basic in-memory key-value store (similar to Redis).
   - Add features like TTL (time-to-live) for keys, persistence to disk, and clustering.
   - **Challenges**: Data structures, caching, serialization, and distributed systems.

2. **Network Packet Sniffer**

   - Write a program that captures and analyzes network packets (like Wireshark but simpler).
   - **Challenges**: Understanding networking protocols, low-level socket programming, and concurrency.

3. **Custom Filesystem**
   - Create a basic filesystem with features like file creation, deletion, and listing.
   - **Challenges**: Memory management, data structures, and operating system concepts.

## **Scalable Applications**

4. **Message Queue System**

   - Build a system like RabbitMQ or Kafka to queue and distribute messages.
   - Add support for topics, consumer groups, and fault tolerance.
   - **Challenges**: Concurrency, scalability, and distributed systems.

5. **Rate Limiter Service**

   - Develop a service that limits requests per user (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
   - Implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms.
   - **Challenges**: High-performance data structures and understanding rate-limiting algorithms.

6. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Simulator**
   - Create a simple CDN that caches and serves static files from multiple locations.
   - **Challenges**: Caching strategies, load balancing, and geographical distribution.

## **Advanced Backend Systems**

7. **Search Engine**

   - Implement a basic search engine that indexes and ranks web pages.
   - Features: Tokenization, inverted index, and ranking algorithms (e.g., TF-IDF).
   - **Challenges**: String processing, large-scale storage, and algorithm optimization.

8. **Distributed Logging System**

   - Build a logging service that collects logs from multiple sources and processes them for analysis.
   - **Challenges**: Handling high-throughput data streams, scaling storage, and ensuring fault tolerance.

9. **Load Balancer**
   - Write a load balancer that distributes traffic across backend servers.
   - Add features like round-robin, least-connections, and health checks.
   - **Challenges**: Networking, concurrency, and fault detection.

## **Web and Cloud-Based Projects**

10. **Scalable Chat Application**

    - Build a real-time chat app with features like group chats, typing indicators, and message persistence.
    - **Challenges**: WebSockets, concurrency, and database scaling.

11. **Distributed Caching Layer**

    - Create a distributed caching system for a web application.
    - Features: Sharding, replication, and consistency models.
    - **Challenges**: Networking, distributed systems, and eventual consistency.

12. **Serverless Function Platform**
    - Build a simple serverless platform where users can deploy and run functions.
    - **Challenges**: Containerization, resource scheduling, and scalability.

## **Computer Science and Algorithms**

13. **Graph Processing Framework**

    - Develop a framework to process large graphs (e.g., for social networks).
    - **Challenges**: Parallel processing, graph traversal algorithms, and memory optimization.

14. **Machine Learning Model Server**

    - Build a server to deploy and serve machine learning models for predictions.
    - **Challenges**: API design, resource management, and optimizing inference speed.

15. **Clustered Web Crawler**
    - Create a web crawler that scales horizontally and respects robots.txt rules.
    - **Challenges**: Distributed systems, rate-limiting, and data storage.

## **Why These Projects?**

- **Scaling Knowledge**: Projects like CDNs, load balancers, and distributed caches teach scalability.
- **CS Fundamentals**: Building parsers, data stores, and search engines deepens algorithmic understanding.
- **Practical Skills**: High-performance apps like chat or todo apps mimic real-world scenarios.
