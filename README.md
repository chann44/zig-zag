# Learning Zig

This repository is all about me learning the **Zig programming language**.

It will contain code related to examples, and that's it. My goal with Zig is to build my understanding of **low-level computing**. Eventually, I want to build my own programming language, but I'll start with smaller projects to get there.

## Projects

### Low-Level Computing

To build my understanding step-by-step, I'll work on the following:

1. **Expression Evaluator**  
   A program to evaluate mathematical expressions, like `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)`.

2. **JSON Parser**  
   Build a basic JSON parser to learn about parsing and memory management.

3. **SQL Query Builder**  
   Write a tool to construct SQL queries programmatically, focusing on abstraction and handling complexity.

4. **Custom Programming Language**  
   Finally, I'll work on designing and implementing a simple programming language, including parsing, interpretation, and compilation.

### UI and Server Development

I also want to build some practical applications to understand Zig's capabilities in real-world scenarios:

1. **Basic Todo App**  
   A high-performance todo app that:
   - Can handle **a billion requests**.
   - Supports simple todos with email notifications.
   - Includes a payment system for additional features.

### Network programing

I also want to write a tcp/udp server form scratch

## Ambitious Goals

This journey is challenging but exciting. I'll focus on building small, manageable projects and scale them up over time.

The ultimate goal is to master Zig while creating something impactful.  
Let's see where this goes. ðŸš€
